# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

On a scale of 1-5, I am about a 3. I could use some more practice. I wish that we could have gotten to a few of the practice items today during the LIVE session or gotten an answer key to some of those items.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

Honestly, Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 seemed really easy and straightforward. Challenge 3 was rather difficult and forced me into productive struggle (assuming I got it correct).

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I would like to go back to the For Statements lesson and do all of the practice problems that I did not have time for today.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I would like to know if there is a better or different way to do Challenge 3 other than selecting each one. Had that been a long array, there must have been a way to set a condition around string length or character length. I just could not figure it out, so I went a different (easier) route.
